# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

The trivia-API is gaming project. In this project, users can take quiz. And questions in this quiz could be asked in different fields or in certain field such as Geography, history, sports, art etc.
in addition, there are other facilities such as:
1-view questions: the users can view question all questions or select specific category 
2-add new question: the user can add new question with answer and select its category beside difficulty.
3- search for questions: according to certain query
4-delete question by select button trash
the main objective of this project is structuring plan, implementing, and testing an API. so the system can handle request from client to server, queries the database, format response and status code. also test API endpoint by Curl.

## Tasks

There are `TODO` comments throughout project. Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

## Starting and Submitting the Project

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [project repository]() and [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine. Work on the project locally and make sure to push all your changes to the remote repository before submitting the link to your repository in the Classroom. 

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. 

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
